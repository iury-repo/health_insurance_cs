## Notebook Name Convention

```
Notebook name example: 0.01-mni-short-description.ipynb

    0 - Data wrangling / description - often includes cleaning, feature creation and initial diagnostics about the raw dataset. Writes data to data/processed or data/interim
    1 - Data exploration - often just for exploratory work and initial diagnostic about the raw dataset.
    2 - Modeling - training machine learning models
    3 - Visualizations - often writes publication-ready viz to reports
    4 - Publication - Notebooks that get turned directly into reports

* mni - Your initials (My Name Initials); this is helpful for knowing who created the notebook and prevents collisions from people working in the same notebook.
* short-description - A description of what the notebook covers, e.g. (data-cleaning, visualizations, fine-tuning, etc)
